NAME
    Apache::GzipChain - compress HTML (or anything) in the OutputChain

SYNOPSIS
    In the configuration of your apache add something like

        <Files *.html>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::OutputChain Apache::GzipChain __your_handler__
        PerlSetVar GzipForce on  # optional
        </Files>

DESCRIPTION
    This module compresses any output from another perl handler if the
    browser requesting the document understands gzip encoding or if the
    config variable ForceGzip is set. To determine if the browser is able to
    understand us we check its *Accept-Encoding* header.

    The module works without influencing the other handlers in the chain.
    The only thing that can be noticed by other handlers is that the
    response header 'Content-Encoding' has been set. If GzipChain decides
    not to do any compression, it just declines and doesn't even register
    itself for the output chain.

    GzipChain compresses every single buffer content it receives via the
    output chain separately according to the GZIP specification (RFC 1952).
    The compression ratio therefore suffers if the other module sends its
    data in very small chunks. It is recommended that you use as few print
    statements as possible in conjunction with the GzipChain. One single
    print statement is recommended.

HEADERS
    This handler sets the header "Content-Encoding" to "gzip" whenever it
    sends gzipped data.

    It also sets or appends to the "Vary" header the values
    "Accept-Encoding" unless the config variable GzipForce is set, in which
    case the output is the same for all user agents.

Unicode
    Using this module under perl-5.8 or higher is ok for Unicode data. UTF-8
    data passed to Compress::Zlib::memGzip() are converted to raw UTF-8
    before compression takes place. Other data are simply passed through.
