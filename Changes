=head1 Revision history for Perl extension Apache::GzipChain.

=head2 0.06  Dec 5, 1997

Added a Vary header, because that's the way HTTP 1.1 commands us.

Bummer: a user reported that his Internet Explorer 3.02 cannot
uncompress. Ok, we said, but we wouldn't send gzipped files to IE
3.02. But the guy was sure he couldn't read the files we were sending.
Inspection revealed that his version of IE (which he insisted was
3.02) sent a User-Agent header that was not a single bit different
from what IE 4.0 sends. GzipChain thusly refrains from sending gzipped
data to IE customers which really hurts. Sorry folks.

Changes in Apache::PassFile: now sends the Last Modified header (can
be turned off)

Improved User-Agent regex for speed. Added the check for the
Accept-Encoding header. Improved documentation.
